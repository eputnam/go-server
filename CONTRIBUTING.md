# CONTRIBUTING.md

## Want to make a contribution?
So you want to make a contribution: awesome! Thanks for stopping by, first of all. Second of all, contributions are welcome -- nay, encouraged! Just give this doc a read and you'll be on your way.

## Commits
Here at go-server, we love good commits. The beefier, the better and typically the more, the merrier.
1. Make sure your commits are made in logical chunks that make sense and can be easily reverted if need be.
2. To point 1, don't commit broken code.
3. Use imperative language in the title and always capitalize the first letter (e.g. "Add cool new feature")
4. In your message, describe the current behavior is, what the new behavior is, and WHY it matters.
