# CONTRIBUTING.md

## Want to make a contribution?
So you want to make a contribution: awesome! First of all, thanks for stopping by. Second of all, contributions are welcome -- nay, encouraged! Just give this doc a read and you'll be on your way.

## Getting started
1. Clone the repository to your workstation
2. Create a branch off of `main` with a name that describes what you're planning to do, e.g. `add-surveys-api` or `update-readme-for-x-thing`.
3. Make your changes (with good commits! see below)
4. Push your branch to GitHub and open a PR against `main`!

## Commits
Here at health-check-server, we love good commits. The beefier, the better and typically the more, the merrier.
1. Make sure your commits are made in logical chunks that make sense and can be easily reverted if need be.
2. To point 1, don't commit broken code.
3. Use imperative language in the title/subject and always capitalize the first letter (e.g. "Add cool new feature")
4. In your message, describe the current behavior is, what the new behavior is, and WHY it matters.
